http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 1 of 11 CASE NO.: Appeal (civil) 4105 of 1999 PETITIONER: MAKHAN LAL BANGAL Vs. For the purpose of this appeal it would suffice to note the issues framed by the High Court, the answers given and the findings recorded by the High Court.

it can be safely concluded from a careful reading of the written statement that (a) Hem Bhattacharya, Dipak Sarkar, Debasis Bose, Nilanjan Chatterjee, Returning Officer, Anindya Kar, Block Development Officer and Assistant Returning Officer, Kushal Mitra, Officer-in-Charge of Sabang Police Station, Pradip Das, Joint BDO, Sabang, Hare Krishna Jana, Sabhapati, Sabang Panchayat Samity; Chitta Bera, election agent of respondent no.1 and Basudeb Bag. - (1) At the time of making an order under section 98 [the High Court] shall also make an order - [(a) where any charge is made in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, recording- (i) a finding whether any corrupt practice has or has not been proved to have been committed at the election, and the nature of that corrupt practice; and (ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and] (b) fixing the total amount of costs payable and specifying the persons by and to whom costs shall be paid: Provided that [a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named] in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless - (a) he as been given notice to appear before [the High Court] and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by [the High Court] and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 11 of being heard.

The opportunity which a party to the petition had at the trial to defend against the allegation of corrupt practice is to be given by such a notice to that person of defending himself if he was not already a party to the petition.

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 11 We too are of the opinion that the fatal defect as noticed by us in the present case vitiates the judgment under appeal and an appropriate course, in the facts and circumstances of the case, would be to set aside the judgment under appeal and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the election petition afresh after compliance with the provisions of Section 99 of R.P. The stage of framing the issues is an important one inasmuch as on that day the scope of the trial is determined by laying the path on which the trial shall proceed excluding diversions and departures therefrom.

Failure to do so has resulted in an utter confusion prevailing throughout the trial and also in the judgment of the High Court as was demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant during the hearing of the appeal attacking the findings arrived at by High Court. Some of the witnesses are asked a few preliminary questions the relevance whereof we have not been able to appreciate.

Wherever necessary a note as to demeanour of a witness can always be made by the presiding judge before whom the witness is being examined and such note on demeanour made in the presence of the witness and counsel for both the parties would be more useful to the trial court itself while hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties at the end of the trial and also for the appellate court rather than a mere record of the statement in question-answer form.
